How was this site built?

This site was built using the tutorial for django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/

The first thing I did was run:

django-admin startproject NASApy

now, although the tutorial does not say it, we need to create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv NASA

now, activate the new virtual environment:

source NASA/bin/activate

(or on windows)
NASA\Scripts\activate.bat

now, I changed directories to the NASApy project, and started a new app:

cd NASApy
python manage.py startapp NASA_api

I followed the tutorial to build a view. After that, I need to make sure my virtual environment downloads the proper packages.

So far, all I need is django. So I created a requirements.txt file, which just contains the django version I want.

Then I installed the packages using the command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Lastly, I started the project with the commmand: python manage.py runserver

My site is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/nasa/ and if I go to that url in my browser, I see my site.
